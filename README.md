# Challenges faced in modern SOCs

Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are critical for protecting organizational assets from cyber threats. However, many organizations face resource constraints, particularly shortage of budget. The growing volume of security alerts burdens these teams, making it difficult to efficiently investigate and respond to genuine threats. However, the efficacy of SOC operations relies on several factors, including the three factors namely People i.e. experience of SOC analysts, Processes and technology i.e. the quality of tools and technologies deployed, the level of automation, and the availability of relevant data sources. Moreover, the lack of standardization in SOC processes and procedures can lead to inefficiencies and gaps in coverage, resulting in an increased risk to the organization. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the existing efficiency and effectiveness of SOC operations by developing standardized processes, improving the quality of tools and technologies, reduce the amount of burden on the analyst and provide them with greater visibility over the networks they are monitoring by automating some of the tasks that take time manually.&#x20;

## Challenges:&#x20;

### Manual Threat Investigation:&#x20;

SOC workflows require manual creation and analysis of security alerts, leading to slow investigation period and eventually may lead to analyst fatigue.&#x20;

### Limited Resources:&#x20;

Resource-constrained SOCs struggle to keep pace with the high volume of alerts, hindering their ability to prioritize and investigate critical incidents. Also as the study implies that budget constraints are also one of the challenges that the small scale companies face.&#x20;

### Alert Fatigue:&#x20;

A high volume of false positives creates alert fatigue, hindering the identification of genuine threats
