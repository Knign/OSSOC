# Overview

## Network

All the machines use the `NAT network` network mode inside of VirtualBox. This allows the malware to be contained in a virtual network such that it does not affect our physical host.

We can learn more about the various networking options inside of VirtualBox from these resources:

* [Virtual Networking](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html)
* [VirtualBox networking - NAT, NAT network, bridged network, internal network, host only network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fkf6Kysh7I\&t=461s)
